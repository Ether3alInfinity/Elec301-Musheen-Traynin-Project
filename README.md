Speech emotion recognition with RAVDESS. 
Explored with Wavelets, MFCC, MLPs, SVMs, and CNNs. Best performance was 3-level Db-4 DWT MFCC on Multiscale Large-Kernel CNN, at 80-81%.

Jupyter Notebook has all the code with comments, but the outputs may be messy. The project report has a more digestible view and goes through my group's journey of researching and coming up with the model we chose, as well as notes and cool takeaways about this project.
